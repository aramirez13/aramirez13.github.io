## Current Reading List

Over the last two years I've had an increased appreciation for reading and writing(Post on that in the future). Currently my chosen style for reading has been on a [kindle paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Ereader/dp/B00AWH595M). It's an e-paper display so it's easy on the eyes, and it can be read in the sunlight. I think it's the perfect blend of having a paper book in digital form. My room isn't that big, so it helps that I can have unlimited number of books that take up no space. Anywho, I thought I would share some of the books that are currently on my kindle. Some read some not. I know it's possible to have to many unread books, so I don't buy another one until I've finished reading at least 1. In a future post, I'll write about why I chose the book and what I took away from it after giving it a read. Just viewing the list will give you an indication as to where my current state of thinking is. Okay enough text. Here's the list:

1) Nikola Tesla " Imagination and the man that invented the 20th century" - by Sean Patrick

2) Outliers "The story of success"- by Malcolm Gladwell

3) Status Anxiety - by Alain de Botton

4) Alone Together "Why we expect more from technolofy and less from each other" - by Sherry Turkle

5) How I lost 170 million dollars "My time as #30 at Facebook"- by Noah Kagan

6) I will teach you to be rich - by Ramit Sethi

7) Quiet "The power of introverts in a world that can't stop talking" - by Susan Cain

8) We Learn Nothing - by Tim Kreider

9) The Obstacle is the way - by Ryan Holiday

10)The Startup of you - by Reid Hoffman & Ben Casnocha

11) Give and Take - by Adam Grant

12) The 4-hour workweek - by Tim Ferriss

13) How to win friends and influence people - Dale Carnegie

That's all for now. I'll continue to update this list as I stumble upon new books.
