My name is Ayasser and I'm a student of life. I'm a Jersey City native pursuing a career in web development. I started this blog as a way to journal my experience as I teach myself the necessary skills for getting a job. Along the way will be some posts that are self-examining as I tend to do alot. There are so many things that I don't understand about the world that I live in. I want to offer my perspective as I read about the perspectives of others. I like people because I can learn from them(either advisory or cautionary). I like that everyone is the star of their own movie in a world shared by 7 billion. Everyone has a story and this is mine. I have many interests and intend to pursue all of them. This is also the best articulated view into my mind. This can do better in describing me, than my spoken words can.

### More Information

Some things I'm interested in(no particular order): technology, philosophy, sociology, self-development, personal finance, psychology, emotional intelligence, video making, photo manipulation, sound recording, games and more that I can't think of at this second.

### Mission

Ultimately, I want to work on something bigger than myself. It would be awesome if I could be part of something that improves lives. I want to embody and embrace the status of permanent beta. Constant self-improvement. I want to encourage people to be the best they can be. To question commonly accepted ideas. To have a different perpective. To ask questions and communicate effectively. To learn from the past and adapt to anything that happens in the future. To laugh and not take yourself too seriously. To see faults in yourself and not dwell on them. To help others because it just feels right. To learn from others because they're smarter than you. To be grateful for everything you have. I want this for myself. I want this for others. It is an honor to be alive in a time where the internet exist. I truly feel like I'm living in one of the best times in history. "Everybody dies, but not everybody lives." I want people to look back after I'm gone and say "He lived life the best way he knew. Being the best he could be". Please don't sue me Drake.

I'm currently 23. I came up with all this in one sitting. You would think that I smoked something before writing. I didn't. I'm high off life. Experiencing life happen is better than any drug. The best part of all this is that I may not feel this way a year from now. How knows, right? I'm kind of random like that. Stay curious my friends!
