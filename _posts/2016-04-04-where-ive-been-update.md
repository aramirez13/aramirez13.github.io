Here's a bit of an update on where I've been since my last post.

Since my last post I've done significantly more work on the podcast that I've started with my bud. To this date we have 8 episodes recorded. We've had the pleasure to have some of our friends as guests. We expanded the show to include a video version. We've created social media accounts. We have affiliate links. We've had the chance to collaborate with other cool companies. I truly believe that each new episode has been better than the last. There's still tons to improve on and I look forward to going on that journey with my co-host. Working on the podcast has been a great project and a great time commitment. Perhaps the biggest I've voluntarily put myself in. 

It has helped in all the ways I thought it would. I've become more familiar with all the tools used in making the podcast. It will be increasingly difficult to balance the new things I want to learn with running the podcast but it feels good having something that I created. With most of my other ideas they have been just that, ideas. They've never turned into action. The podcast is the first one of those things. Well, technically this blog is the first thing, but the podcast is the first thing I thoroughly planned out and executed on. I hope to have more planning on the  future. On to bigger and better things. Expect some more posts soon as I plan to share some of my latest experiences as I attempt to learn stuff.
