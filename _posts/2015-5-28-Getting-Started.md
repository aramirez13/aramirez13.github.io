Sup. You have no idea how much of a bitch this was to set up. I'm not sure which was harder, physically setting it up, or making my mind up. You see, indecision is the bane of my existence. I don't mean to do it. I think that most of the time I get caught up trying things to work perfectly. I recently heard a podcast where they mentioned the phrase "Perfection is paralysis."
If everyone waited for the perfect thing to do it would never be done. This is a huge lesson for me because I over-think just about everything. I wouldn't consider myself a perfectionist but I sometimes think that I like thinking more than doing. Whenever I have to do something, I rather read and learn about it rather than actually do it. Enough is enough. This is the first straw. I am finally doing. You may relate to this, and if you do, go out and do something! Stop reading about it. Just do it! (Please don't sue me Nike)
This is my first and hopefully not my last post. You have no idea. This didn’t even worked when I first typed it up. This isn’t the theme wanted. Hopefully one lesson learned among many. UGHHHHHH
