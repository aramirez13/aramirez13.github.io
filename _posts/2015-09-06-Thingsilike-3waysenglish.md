## Things I like

Here's a video I like because how it peels back the identities behind language. Part of socialization is adapting to an evironments social conventions, language being one of them. This doesn't speak of a different language per se, but more so a way of speaking that demonstrates an high level of articulation. In this talk Jamila Lyiscott bring together her work, friend and home language to an audience that would surely judge her, had she only spoke the latter two. Language is that which helps us communicate. It is socially constucted. It is beautiful. It is unbounded. It is human.
