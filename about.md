My name is Ayasser and I'm a student of life. I'm a Jersey City native pursuing a career in web development. I started this blog as a way to journal my experience as I teach myself the necessary skills for getting a job. Along the way will be some posts that are self-examining as I tend to do alot. I have many interest and intend to pursue all of them. This is also the best articulated view into my mind. This can do better in describing me, than my spoken words can.

### More Information

Some things I'm interested in(no particular order): technology, philosophy, sociology, self-development, personal finance, psychology, emotional intelligence, video making, photo manipulation, sound recording, games and more that I can't think of at this second.
