Just a quick post on something I'm working on. I've been wanting to do a podcast in some form for a while now. In the spirit of pursuing my intrest I'm going to announce a test I'm conducting. The test involves voicing over some of my previous blog posts. This way they'll be available in a text and audio form. I'm really just trying to find the best medium for saying what I want to say. Maybe the next logical step is video? The hope is that the test will allow me to start easy and get used to the process of editing audio. I haven't thought too much about how it will be available, although, I think soundcloud is a good start. Also, take a look at the photo of mic. This is the actual mic that I'll be using in the podcast test. Photo was taken by me in my room with the Nikon D3300. My room is basically a cave so this camera did really well in low light. That's all for now. I'll catch you in the next post.
